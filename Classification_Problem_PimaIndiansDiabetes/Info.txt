The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset involves predicting the onset of diabetes within 5 years in Pima Indians given medical details.

It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable. Missing values are believed to be encoded with zero values. The variable names are as follows:

Number of times pregnant.
Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
Diabetes pedigree function.
Age (years).
Class variable (0 or 1).
The baseline performance of predicting the most prevalent class is a classification accuracy of approximately 65%. Top results achieve a classification accuracy of approximately 77%.

3. Past Usage:
    1. Smith,~J.~W., Everhart,~J.~E., Dickson,~W.~C., Knowler,~W.~C., \&
       Johannes,~R.~S. (1988). Using the ADAP learning algorithm to forecast
       the onset of diabetes mellitus.  In {\it Proceedings of the Symposium
       on Computer Applications and Medical Care} (pp. 261--265).  IEEE
       Computer Society Press.

       The diagnostic, binary-valued variable investigated is whether the
       patient shows signs of diabetes according to World Health Organization
       criteria (i.e., if the 2 hour post-load plasma glucose was at least 
       200 mg/dl at any survey  examination or if found during routine medical
       care).   The population lives near Phoenix, Arizona, USA.

       Results: Their ADAP algorithm makes a real-valued prediction between
       0 and 1.  This was transformed into a binary decision using a cutoff of 
       0.448.  Using 576 training instances, the sensitivity and specificity
       of their algorithm was 76% on the remaining 192 instances.

4. Relevant Information:
      Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from
      a larger database.  In particular, all patients here are females at
      least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.  ADAP is an adaptive learning
      routine that generates and executes digital analogs of perceptron-like
      devices.  It is a unique algorithm; see the paper for details.

8. Missing Attribute Values: Yes

9. Class Distribution: (class value 1 is interpreted as "tested positive for
   diabetes")
